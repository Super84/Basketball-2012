# Basketball-2012
GLAR Team #4381's code for the 2012 basketball robot, remade for the Sasquatch that's programmed in Arduino.

Note for future programmers: this code was used for simply running the functions of the robot. If you need to revamp the code or reapply the code to the Sasquatch, you will need to download the libraries found here: http://www.team221.com/robotopen/library.html
